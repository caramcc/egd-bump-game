#| ABOUT/ TODO
personal space optimization as measured by the distance between the player
and the other npcs in the scene

every 5 seconds a new score snapshot is taken, every 10-15 a new enemy is added,
and they shuffle in and out and adjust and move around

the player grows redder as an indication of how badly they're doing.
