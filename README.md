# Bump

===

A crowd navigation game for GAME1850 - Experimental Game Design at NEU.

## Playing

Controls: **WASD** or **arrow keys** to move. Spacebar to forfeit.

Objective: Navigate to each goal. Run into as few other people as possible.

## TODO
### General TODO
- aesthetics (currently bad, bordering on terrible)
- refactor (hackathon-style authorship that would make my fundies professors weep)
- tests (for the love of god)

### Features and Fixes
- improve enemy spawning and goal spawning
- - prevent enemies from spawning out of bounds, on goal, on player
- - prevent enemies from moving on goal (or flag that they're on goal)
- tdb after playtests
